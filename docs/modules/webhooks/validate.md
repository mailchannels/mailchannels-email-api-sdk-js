# Validate<llm-exclude> <Badge type="info">method</Badge> <Badge><a href="/modules/webhooks">📢 Webhooks</a></Badge></llm-exclude>

Validates whether your enrolled webhook(s) respond with an HTTP `2xx` status code. Sends a test request to each webhook containing your customer handle, a hardcoded event type (`test`), a hardcoded sender email (`test@mailchannels.com`), a timestamp, a request ID (provided or generated), and an SMTP ID. The response includes the HTTP status code and body returned by each webhook.

## Usage

::: code-group
```ts [modular.ts]
import { MailChannelsClient, Webhooks } from 'mailchannels-sdk'

const mailchannels = new MailChannelsClient('your-api-key')
const webhooks = new Webhooks(mailchannels)

const { data, error } = await webhooks.validate('optional-request-id')
```

```ts [full.ts]
import { MailChannels } from 'mailchannels-sdk'

const mailchannels = new MailChannels('your-api-key')

const { data, error } = await mailchannels.webhooks.validate('optional-request-id')
```
